:+1::tada: Thanks for thinking about contributing! :tada::+1:

The cyber-dojo source is split across three github organizations.

- [cyber-dojo](https://github.com/cyber-dojo)
  - contains 20+ git repositories, one for each service that together comprise the server.
  - you create new practice sessions by choosing from a set of start-points, one for each language+testFramework (eg `"Java, JUnit"`).
  - [I'd like to contribute to the server](https://github.com/cyber-dojo/cyber-dojo/blob/master/docs/how-to-contribute-to-server.md)

- [cyber-dojo-start-points](https://github.com/cyber-dojo-start-points)
  - contains 80+ git repositories, one for each language+testFramework `start-point`.
  - for example, the start-point files for `"Java, JUnit"` live in [https://github.com/cyber-dojo-start-points/java-junit](https://github.com/cyber-dojo-start-points/java-junit).
  - each one specifies its initial source files and the name of the docker image they run inside.
  - [I'd like to contribute to the start-points](https://github.com/cyber-dojo/cyber-dojo/blob/master/docs/how-to-contribute-to-start-points.md)

- [cyber-dojo-languages](https://github.com/cyber-dojo-languages)
  - contains 80+ git repositories, one for each language+testFramework docker `image`.
  - for example, the Dockerfile for `"Java, JUnit"` lives in [https://github.com/cyber-dojo-languages/java-junit](https://github.com/cyber-dojo-languages/java-junit).
  - [I'd like to contribute to the languages](https://github.com/cyber-dojo/cyber-dojo/blob/master/docs/how-to-contribute-to-languages.md)

:+1::tada: Thanks for thinking about contributing! :tada::+1:

There is a cyber-dojo [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/cyber-dojo/projects/3/views/1)  

There four ways to contribute:

- [I'd like to contribute to the server](https://github.com/cyber-dojo/cyber-dojo/blob/master/docs/how-to-contribute-to-server.md)
  - The [cyber-dojo](https://github.com/cyber-dojo) Org contains 10+ git repositories, one for each service that together comprise the server.

- [I'd like to contribute to the exercises](https://github.com/cyber-dojo/exercises-start-points/blob/main/docs/contributing.md)
  - The [cyber-dojo-exercises](https://github.com/cyber-dojo/exercises-start-points) repo in the cyber-dojo Org holds the 50+ exercises

- I'd like to contribute the language/test-frameworks
  - each language/test-frameworks, such as `Java, JUnit`, is split into two parts:
    - The [cyber-dojo-languages](https://github.com/cyber-dojo-languages) Org contains 80+ git repositories, one for each language+testFramework docker `image`.
      - for example, the Dockerfile for `Java, JUnit` lives in [https://github.com/cyber-dojo-languages/java-junit](https://github.com/cyber-dojo-languages/java-junit).
      - [I'd like to contribute to the language images](https://github.com/cyber-dojo/cyber-dojo/blob/master/docs/how-to-contribute-to-languages.md)
 
    - The [cyber-dojo-start-points](https://github.com/cyber-dojo-start-points) Org contains 80+ git repositories, one for each language+testFramework `start-point`.
      - for example, the start-point files for `Java, JUnit` live in [https://github.com/cyber-dojo-start-points/java-junit](https://github.com/cyber-dojo-start-points/java-junit).
      - each repo specifies the initial source files (typically one source file and one test file) and the name of the docker image they run inside.
      - [I'd like to contribute a language/test-framework start-points](https://github.com/cyber-dojo/cyber-dojo/blob/master/docs/how-to-contribute-to-start-points.md)

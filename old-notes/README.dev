The cyber-dojo web server now lives inside a docker image called cyberdojo/web
which is just one of the images controlled by the docker-compose.yml
file inside the main cyberdojo/commander image.

To rebuild the web image and run all the tests inside its container

$ ./pipe_build_up_test.sh

This assumes you have commander's github repo next to web's github repo.
Running the tests locally (not inside a web container) is no longer supported.
